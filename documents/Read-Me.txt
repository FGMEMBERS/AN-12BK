I have now included the original manual from AN-12,
it is in russian language and has about 570 pages,
you may open it with any PDF-reader:

(you get it in the git repository also)

On this russian airspoter page you find all kinds off constuction and
operating manuals for a lot of old and not so old aircrafts.




For better implementation of instrumens there are some fotos from here:

sorry to say, but this is not a AN-12, so we have to work on it,
but nevertheless thanks for starting this project.
